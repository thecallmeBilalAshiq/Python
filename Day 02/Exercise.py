### Task 1: Data Types
1. Define the following variables:
    - `age`: an integer representing your age.
    - `temperature`: a floating-point number representing the current temperature in Celsius.
    - `is_sunny`: a boolean variable indicating whether it's a sunny day.
    - `city`: a string containing the name of your favorite city.
    - `description`: a variable with the value `"Python Basics"`.
2. Print the value of `age`.

### Task 2: Operators
1. Calculate the product of `5` and `3` using the arithmetic operator `*`. Print the result.
2. Update the value of `temperature` by adding `10.5` to it. Print the updated temperature.
3. Evaluate whether `is_sunny` is `True`. Print the result.

### Task 3: Logical Operators
1. Create a new boolean variable `is_warm` and set it to `True`.
2. Use logical operators to determine whether it's both sunny and warm. Print the result.

### Task 4: Type Conversion
1. Given the string `"7.8"`, convert it to a float and print the result.
2. Given the integer `42`, convert it to a string and print the result.

### Task 5: User Input
1. Prompt the user to enter their favorite color using `input()` and then Print a message that includes their color preference.
2. Prompt the user to enter their age(in integer) using `input()`

### Task 6: Square Calculation
1. Prompt the user to enter a number (`x`) using `input()`.
2. Convert the input to an integer.
3. Calculate and print the square of the number (`x`) using the exponentiation operator (`**`).
